# StudioExtraMoveAxis
A plugin for studio in many Illusion games that adds extra move gizmo in bottom right corner. It can be turned on and off with a new button on the left edge of the screen.

Currently supports PH, KK, AI and HS2.

Inspired by a feature in shortcutsKoi.

### How to use
1. Make sure at least [BepInEx v5.1](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx), and latest [BepisPlugins](https://github.com/bbepis/BepisPlugins) and [Modding API](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/KKAPI) are installed, and your game is updated.
2. Download the latest release for your game (KK = for Koikatsu, etc.)
3. Extract the archive directly into your game's directory (it has a BepInEx folder, it should merge with your existing BepInEx folder).
4. Start studio, see if there are any errors on the screen.
5. Create a new object and click the "Extra" button in the toolbar on the left of the screen. The gizmo should appear in bottom right corner.

You can change how the new gizmo works in plugin settings (settings may vary per game, PH has none).
